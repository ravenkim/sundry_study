All surfaces (background, card, popover, sidebar) should use subtle variations of the same base color, with enough contrast to distinguish them when they are next to each other. For brand colors (primary, secondary, muted, accent, ring) keep original color palette. Minimize borders and shadows. For shadows, you can set 'shadow-opacity' to 0% or near 0% or make them barely visible. For borders, use a subtle grayscale color. Typography should be clean, modern, and easy to read, with no decorative fonts. The overall look should be calm, simple, and highly functional.",

For shadows, use a 'shadow-color' that also contrasts sharply with the 'background', set 'shadow-blur' to '0px', 'shadow-opacity' to '100%', and use 'shadow-offset-x', 'shadow-offset-y', and 'shadow-spread' to create a hard, offset shadow effect, but try not to exceed 4px. For brand colors (primary, secondary, muted, accent, ring) keep original color palette, and make colors slightly more vibrant, for that you can increase saturation, but keep hue-consistent.",
